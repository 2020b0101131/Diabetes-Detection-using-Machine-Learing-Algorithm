--> Objective

i) The primary aim of this project is to analyse the Diabetes Dataset and use Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors & Decision Tree algorithms for prediction.

ii) Allow users to predict diabetes utilizing the prediction engine.

iii) The objective is set to achieve the aims of the project through a Research on statistical models in machine learning and to understand how the algorithms works

--> Motivation

Diabetes is a chronic disease that can pose a global public health crisis. Diabetes mellitus, or diabetes, is a disease caused by elevated blood sugar levels. It is one of the most deadly diseases on the rise worldwide.

Various traditional methods based on physical and chemical examination are available for diagnosing diabetes. Data science techniques have the potential to benefit other scientific disciplines by shedding new light on frequently asked questions. Machine learning is a new branch of data science that deals with how machines learn from experience. 

This study focuses on recent developments in machine learning that have had a significant impact on diabetes detection and diagnosis. We also aim to propose an effective method for early detection of diabetes.

--> Conclusion

In this study, various machine learning algorithms were applied to the data set to Classification was performed with different algorithms. It is observed that the accuracy achieved throught the use of SVM was 77 percent, accuracy using Decision Tree was 75 percent and accuracy achieved through KNN was 72 percent. Of these, SVM has the highest accuracy of 77%. We compared the accuracy of machine learning algorithms using same dataset. It is clear that models using this dataset improve the accuracy and precision of diabetes prediction compared to existing datasets. Additionally, this study could be extended to examine the likelihood that non-diabetics will develop diabetes in the next few years.
